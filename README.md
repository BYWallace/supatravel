#SupaTravel

##Overview:
[SupaTravel](http://supatravel.herokuapp.com/ "SupaTravel") is a travel themed photo-blogging Rails application developed over a three day sprint. While fully functional, and visually pleasing, the project was initially intended as an exercise for [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive "General Assembly") students to colloborate using agile develoment techniques such as frequent scrumming, as well as gain more exposure to git and github.  The exercise accurately mimicked an industry-relevant scenario in which a team of developers is met with impending deadlines set forth by a needy and indecisive client (portrayed by one of our GA instructors, Greg).

##Technologies Used:
